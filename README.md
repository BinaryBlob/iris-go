  Iris Go Binding
===================

This is the official Go language binding for the Iris decentralized messaging framework. For details about Iris itself, please visit the [Iris website](http://iris.karalabe.com).

  Contributions
-----------------

Currently my development aims are to stabilize the project and its language bindigns. Hence, although I'm open and very happy for any and all contributions, the most valuable ones are tests, benchmarks and actual binding usage to reach a high enough quality.

Due to the already significant complexity of the project (Iris in general), I kindly ask anyone willing to pinch in to first file an [issue](https://github.com/karalabe/iris-go/issues) with their plans to achieve a best possible integration :).
